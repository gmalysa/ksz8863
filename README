This is a barebones driver for the KSZ8863 switch. Currently, it just turns the switch on and
uses it in unmanaged mode.

As necessary, a sysfs interface will be added to support changing switch settings.

To configure the switch in your device tree:

&ecspi1 {
    ksz8863: ksz8863@0 {
        compatible = "microchip,ksz8863";
        reg = <0>;
        status = "okay";

        spi-max-frequency = <4000000>;
        spi-cpol;
        spi-cpha;
    };
};

To configure the FEC on an imx device to use it, use a fixed-link connection:

&fec {
    pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_enet>;
    phy-mode = "rmii";
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;
    status = "okay";

    fixed-link {
        speed = <100>;
        full-duplex;
    };
};
